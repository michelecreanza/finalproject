      <h1> HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN BEER</h1>

      <p>
        So you’ve decided to make your own beer at home. Congratulations! You’re
        about to engage in a wondrous and rewarding task almost as old as
        humanity itself. But there’s no reason to be intimidated. Although
        people have been brewing beer for millennia, the basic process has
        remained much the same through the ages. This article will discuss what
        home brewing equipment you need to get started as well as walk you
        through the basic steps of how to brew an American amber bock. It’s
        time, as homebrewing godfather Charlie Papazian says, to “Relax, don’t
        worry, have a homebrew.” The Basic Brewing Process First off,
        homebrewing can be divided into two types: all grain and extract. Beer
        is made using the sugars from malted (partially germinated) grains. In
        all grain brewing, the homebrewer via a series of steps extracts these
        sugars from milled grains him or herself. In extract brewing, the
        homebrewer uses ready-made malt extract, skipping the sugar extraction
        process entirely as it has already been done. Extract brewing is a good
        starting point for most new homebrewers because the process requires
        minimal beer equipment and procedures while still producing quality
        beer, and it’s the type of brewing we’ll focus on here. Equipment You
        Need to Make Your Own Beer You may know someone who has converted his or
        her entire basement or garage into what practically looks like a
        professional brewery, full of shiny tanks and kegs, welded pipework,
        washing stations, and fridges with tap handles always pouring out
        beautiful foamy beer. But rest assured there is no need to invest a
        fortune to get started making your own beer. The easiest way to go is to
        just buy a basic homebrewing kit. You can always add fancier brewing
        gadgets after you’ve brewed for a while and decided it’s something you
        love (which you will, of course). The basic kit consists of: 6.5-gallon
        "Ale Pail" primary fermenter with lid 6.5-gallon "Ale Pail" bottling

        bottling set-up Hydrometer Bottle cleaning brush Twin lever bottle
        capper Liquid crystal thermometer Bucket clip Home beer making booklet
        Equipment instructions You will also need a cooking thermometer and a
        3-5 gallon stock pot, which is available as an add-on if you don’t
        already have one. Ingredients of Beer Making Now that you have the
        equipment taken care of, let’s go over the main ingredients of beer.
        There are only four: hops, grains (and/or malt extract), yeast, and
        water. We’ll look at each one individually. So you’ve decided to make

        Beer Making Now that you have the equipment taken care of, let’s go over
        the main ingredients of beer. There are only four: hops, grains (and/or
        malt extract), yeast, and water. We’ll look at each one individually.
        Hops Hops are the flowers (cones, really) of the plant Humulus lupulus.
        Hop cones from female plants are used in brewing and contain the alpha
        acids that determine that particular hop’s bitterness. The higher the
        alpha acid percentage, the more bitterness that hop will contribute to
        your boil. Typical boils last 60 or more minutes because the hops’ alpha
        resins are not readily soluble in water and must be boiled for at least
        an hour to release their bitterness. Important note: The acid percentage
        of hops varies from year to year, hop variety to hop variety, and region
        to region, so it’s important to keep good records of your brewing so
        that you can duplicate your successful brews. Refer to the package your
        hops come in for the most accurate alpha acid percentage. In addition to
        being used in the boil to add bitterness to your finished beer, hops are
        also added toward the end of the boil to impart aroma and fragrance.
        This is important because much of what we perceive as taste comes
        through our sense of smell. Hops used in the boil are called bittering
        (or boiling) hops, while hops added at the end are known as aromatic (or
        finishing) hops. Grains Even if you are brewing with malt extract, using
        a small amount of what are called “specialty grains” can help give your
        beer added flavor, aroma, color, and body. Buying your grains from a
        reputable homebrew shop like Adventures in Homebrewing will help ensure
        that you’re getting grains that are fresh and have been stored properly.
        To be used in making beer, grains must first be milled (or crushed). You
        can do this at home if you have a grain mill or other method capable of
        crushing the grains finely, or you can do it (or have it done) at the
        homebrew shop. Crushed grains should be used as soon as possible, while
        uncrushed grains will store well for up to four months. Malt Extracts
        Using malt extracts is a convenient way of making your own beer and can
        make the process more enjoyable for new brewers. Whether you have just a
        few or more than a hundred batches under your belt, extracts can produce
        exceptional beers. The quality of extracts has improved greatly over the
        years and can be depended on to provide consistent results. Malt extract
        is available in a liquid (LME) or dry (DME) form. But be careful: which
        form you use affects how much you need for a given recipe. You can use a
        simple calculation to help determine what kind of original gravity – a
        measure of the fermentable sugars in your unfermented beer (wort) – you
        can expect from LME vs. DME. Here is the rule of thumb: 1 lb LME will
        produce a 1.044 original gravity when dissolved in 1 gallon of water. 1
        lb DME will produce a 1.037 original gravity when dissolved in 1 gallon
        of water. You can use these calculations to determine how many pounds of
        LME or DME you need to achieve a known original gravity if you aren’t
        using a pre-measured recipe kit. Yeast Beer was brewed for millennia
        before brewers understood the role yeast played in fermentation. Today,
        you may have heard the common saying, “Brewers make wort; yeast makes
        beer.” In brewing, yeast, which is a single-celled fungus, consumes the
        malt sugars and produces alcohol and CO2. Like malt extract, brewer’s
        yeast comes in liquid or dry form. It used to be that dry yeast was
        looked down upon as being of poor quality and not adding much to the
        beer, but these days there are many varieties of dry yeast made
        specifically for different beer types. There are advantages and
        disadvantages to using either dry yeast or liquid yeast. Dry yeast has a
        long shelf life and requires minimal preparation to use. Liquid yeast
        comes in vastly more varieties than dry yeast but has a shorter shelf
        life and requires more careful handling. Either way, you can achieve the
        quality beer you are looking for. Water The quality of the water you
        brew with is important because beer is more than 90 percent water.
        Basically, water used for making beer needs to be clean and free of
        odors (a typical example of odor is chlorine). Other factors to consider
        with your water include its pH and “hardness” (minerality). Good brewing
        water should be moderately hard and have low to moderate alkalinity.
        There are ways to adjust your water chemistry, if necessary, to get it
        where you want it; however, many homebrewers make perfectly good beer
        with “as-is” tap water. Making Your Beer We’ve gone over the equipment
        and the main ingredients you need to homebrew. Now let’s take a look at
        a classic Adventures in Homebrewing extract beer recipe kit: our
        American Amber Bock. Your first question is probably: Is it an amber or
        a bock beer? It’s both! We’ve had so many requests over the years for
        this hybrid style that we did a bunch of research and came up with this
        recipe. Here are the details: Yield: 5 gallons Original gravity: 1.057
        Final gravity: 1.014 Color/SRM: Amber Alcohol by volume: 5.55% IBU
        (anticipated, alpha acids can fluctuate): 31 Specialty grains: Dark
        Munich, Crystal 120L, Victory Hops: Cluster (boiling), Saaz (finishing)
        Recipe kit includes: Liquid malt, specialty grains in a grain bag, and
        hops This recipe is very popular here at Adventures in Homebrewing. At
        5.5% ABV, the alcohol content does not overpower the maltiness of the
        Victory and Munich malts, and the aroma of the Saaz hops comes through
        nicely. This particular recipe is perfect for beginners and well
        balanced for the experienced brewer as well. Now let’s go through the
        steps to make your beer. Procedure Always read all the instructions
        before you begin brewing, so you can be sure you have everything you
        need on hand (equipment, ingredients) and that you fully understand the
        procedure. Clean and Sanitize Thoroughly clean and sanitize all of your
        brewing equipment. Steep Your Grains Start by heating 2.5 gallons of
        water in your brew pot. Add the (crushed) specialty grains to the grain
        bag: 0.5 lbs Crystal (120 °L+) 0.5 lbs Dark Munich 0.25 lbs Victory Tie
        a knot at one end of the grain bag, leaving room for the grains to be
        loose in the bag. Place the grain bag in the water. Slowly raise the
        temperature to 150°F to 160°F. Steep your grains at this temperature for
        20 minutes. Remove the grain bag from the pot. Do not squeeze the bag;
        just let the liquid drain from the bag into the pot. You now officially
        have “wort” – unfermented beer. But there are several other steps to
        fully prepare your wort for fermentation. Begin the Boil Bring the wort
        to a rolling boil, being careful to avoid a boil-over. Once you’ve
        achieved a boil, remove the brew pot from the heat source. Now add: 7
        lbs Pale LME 1 oz Saaz hops Stir the wort until the malt extract has
        completely dissolved. Any undissolved extract allowed to sit on the
        bottom of the pot will burn, so make sure you’ve stirred thoroughly
        before returning the wort to a rolling boil. Add Aromatic Hops Let your
        wort boil for 55 minutes, then add: 1 oz Saaz hops These are your
        aromatic (or finishing) hops. Because you are boiling them for only five
        minutes, they add no bitterness but contribute their aroma and fragrance
        to the finished beer. Cool the Wort Following the 60-minute boil, you’ll
        need to cool your wort down to below 100°F as quickly as possible. There
        are many ways to do this, but we at Adventures in Homebrewing recommend
        using a wort chiller. (See our “How to Cool Wort Fast” page.) If you
        haven’t already, now is a good time to sanitize your fermentation
        equipment, i.e., the “Ale Pail,” airlock, hose, and hydrometer. Your
        wort at this point is a big feast for microbes, and you don’t want any
        uninvited guests showing up to the dinner party. Anything that may come
        into contact with the wort should be sanitary. Transfer the Wort to the
        Fermenter Siphon the cooled wort into your primary fermentation vessel
        (your “Ale Pail” if you’re using the basic homebrewing equipment kit),
        then top it off with enough cold water so that you have five gallons.
        You’ll also want to aerate the wort, either by using a diffusion stone
        or simply by rocking the fermenter back and forth once the lid is in
        place. Determine Your Original Gravity Now is when you want to use your
        hydrometer to measure the wort’s original gravity (OG), which basically
        indicates a number of fermentable sugars present. You’ll want to record
        the number as you will use it later, along with your final gravity
        reading, to calculate your beer’s alcohol by volume (ABV). (See our “How
        to Read a Hydrometer” page.) Pitch the Yeast Now it’s time to add, or
        “pitch,” your yeast into the wort. During fermentation, the yeast will
        consume the malt sugars and produce alcohol and CO2. The wort should be
        cooled to around 78°F before you pitch your yeast, but follow the
        procedures outlined on the yeast package. We suggest using one of the
        following yeasts for the American Amber Bock: White Labs 001 California
        Ale Yeast. Famous for its clean flavors, balance, and ability to be used
        in almost any style ale. It accentuates the hop flavors and is extremely
        versatile. Wyeast 1056 American Ale Yeast. Very clean, crisp flavor
        characteristics with low fruitiness and mild ester production. A very
        versatile yeast for styles that require dominant malt and hop character.
        This strain makes a wonderful “house” strain. Mild citrus notes develop
        with cooler 60-66°F (15-19ºC) fermentations. Fermentis Safale US-05. A
        ready-to-pitch American ale yeast for well-balanced beers with low
        diacetyl and a very crisp end palate. After you’ve pitched the yeast,
        seal the fermenter tight, attach the sanitized airlock and stopper, and
        fill the airlock with water. Let the Wort Ferment Put the fermenter in
        an out-of-the-way, temperature-stable place. You should see activity
        within 24-48 hours as CO2 begins to escape the airlock. It will take
        from one to two weeks for the fermentation to complete, during which
        time you should do nothing to disturb the process. Some brewers include
        a secondary fermentation step after about a week. It involves siphoning
        the beer into a secondary fermenter, such as a glass carboy, and
        allowing it to condition for another week or two. This step is optional
        (at least for some beers), but the advantages include allowing the beer
        to clear more, resulting in less sediment once you’ve kegged or bottled
        it. Determine Your Final Gravity and Calculate ABV Use your hydrometer
        to take a reading of the beer’s final gravity (FG). You can calculate
        the beer’s approximate ABV using the following formula: ABV = (OG - FG)
        x 131.25 So using our targets for the American Amber Bock, we’d get:
        (1.057-1.014 ) x 131.25 = 5.64% ABV Note that this calculation provides
        only an approximation of the beer’s ABV, but it is the simplest method
        and is generally “good enough” for homebrewing. Keg or Bottle Your Beer
        Siphon the finished beer into the bottling bucket. If the recipe calls
        for any bottling additives (such as priming sugar) to be added to the
        bottling bucket, add them now. At this point, follow kegging or bottling
        procedures. Visit our “Cornelius Kegging Guide” page. Visit our “How to
        Bottle Beer” page. That’s all there is to making your own beer. After
        allowing the beer to condition, it’s time to share it with friends and
        family and brag about how you made it yourself. Welcome to homebrewing!
        Now you know the basic process for brewing your own beer at home. As you
        gain experience and confidence, you can work in more wrinkles, such as
        using gypsum to harden your brewing water (if necessary) or adding Irish
        moss to your boil to help with beer clarity. There are many other
        aspects to homebrewing and we’re here to help you with all of them. Be
        sure to read our other “How-To” pages covering different brewing
        subjects. Or contact us with your questions. Happy brewing!
